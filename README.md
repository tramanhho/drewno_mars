Drew, 

Here is the command to install Rust and `cargo`, if you need it:

```shell
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

In any case, `make` and `./dmc <input.dm> -n <output.txt>` should work. 

In advance, we know that the class--member field access and detecting when variables go out of scope do not work.
