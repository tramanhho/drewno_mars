Drew Davidson, 

Here is the command to install Rust and `cargo`, if you need it:

```shell
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

In any case, `make` and `./dmc <input.dm> -o <output.s>` should work. To aid in the ease of grading, we will mention that we did not implement anything related to function calling e.g. call/getarg/setarg :(( These projects were fun, though!!!
